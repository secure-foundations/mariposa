	 - If S the symmetry clause ~E(x,y) \/ E(y,x) is added
	 - If T the transitivity clause ~E(x,y) \/ ~E(y,z) \/ E(x,z) is added

	distinct free variables of t and f does not appear in t. If 'all', definitions 
	are eliminated by replacing every occurrence of f(s1,..,sn) by t{x1 ->

	the axiom n(x1,..,xk) <=> F(x1,..,xk) and replacing F(x1,..,xk) with n(x1,..,xk) 
	in G. The value indicates how many times a subformula must be used before

	of non-equality predicates in the whole CNF.
	default: off
--shuffle_input (-si)
	Randomly shuffle the input problem. (Runs after and thus destroys normalize.)
	default: off
--sine_depth (-sd)
	Limit number of iterations of the transitive closure algorithm that selects 
	formulas based on SInE's D-relation (see SInE description). 0 means no 
	limit, 1 is a maximal limit (least selected axioms), 2 allows two iterations, 
	etc...
	default: 0
--sine_generality_threshold (-sgt)
	Generality of a symbol is the number of input formulas in which a symbol 
	appears. If the generality of a symbol is smaller than the threshold, it 
	is always added into the D-relation with formulas in which it appears.
	default: 0
--sine_selection (-ss)
	If 'axioms', all formulas that are not annotated as 'axiom' (i.e. conjectures 
	and hypotheses) are initially selected, and the SInE selection is performed 
	on those annotated as 'axiom'. If 'included', all formulas that are directly 
	in the problem file are initially selected, and the SInE selection is performed 
	on formulas from included files. The 'included' value corresponds to the 
	behaviour of the original SInE implementation.
	default: off
	values: axioms,included,off
--sine_tolerance (-st)
	SInE tolerance parameter (sometimes referred to as 'benevolence')
	default: 1
--sos (-sos)
	Set of support strategy. All formulas annotated as axioms are put directly 
	among active clauses, without performing any inferences between them. If

	default: off
--unused_predicate_definition_removal (-updr)
	Attempt to remove predicate definitions. A predicate definition is a formula 
	of the form ![X1,..,Xn] : (p(X1,..,XN) <=> F) where p is not equality and 
	does not occur in F and X1,..,XN are the free variables of F. If p has 
	only positive (negative) occurrences then <=> in the definition can be 
	replaced by => (<=). If p does not occur in the rest of the problem the 
	definition can be removed.
	default: on

	age/weight choices.
	default: 100
--increased_numeral_weight (-inw)

	of integer constants depends on the logarithm of their absolute value (instead 
	of being 1)

	Decides where to place symbols introduced during proof search in the symbol 
	precedence
	default: top
	values: top,bottom
--literal_comparison_mode (-lcm)
	Vampire uses term orderings which use an ordering of predicates. Standard 
	places equality (and certain other special predicates) first and all others 
	second. Predicate depends on symbol precedence (see symbol_precedence). 
	Reverse reverses the order.
	default: standard
	values: predicate,reverse,standard
--literal_maximality_aftercheck (-lma)
	For efficiency we perform maximality checks before applying substitutions.

	use a tammet-style-arrangement.
	default: off
--positive_literal_split_queue_ratios (-plsqr)
	The ratios for picking clauses from the positive-literal-split-queues using 
	weighted round robin. If a queue is empty, the clause will be picked from

	apart from those under the relevant heading
	default: lrs
	values: discount,fmb,inst_gen,lrs,otter,z3
--selection (-s)
	Selection methods 2,3,4,10,11 are complete by virtue of extending Maximal 
	i.e. they select the best among maximal. Methods 1002,1003,1004,1010,1011

	If turned on, use a layered arrangement to split clauses into queues. Otherwise 
	use a tammet-style-arrangement.
	default: on
--sine_level_split_queue_ratios (-slsqr)
	The ratios for picking clauses from the sine-level-split-queues using weighted 
	round robin. If a queue is empty, the clause will be picked from the next 
	non-empty queue to the right. Note that this option implicitly also sets 
	the number of queues.
	default: 1,1
--sine_to_age (-s2a)
	Use SInE levels to postpone introducing clauses more distant from the conjecture 
	to proof search by artificially making them younger (age := sine_level).

	Assign levels to predicate symbols as they are used to trigger axioms during 
	SInE computation. Then use them as predicateLevels determining the ordering.

	keeps its standard lowest level).
	default: off
	values: no,off,on
--symbol_precedence (-sp)
	Vampire uses term orderings which require a precedence relation between 
	symbols.
	Arity orders symbols by their arity (and reverse_arity takes the reverse 
	of this) and occurence orders symbols by the order they appear in the problem. 
	Then we have a few precedence generating schemes adopted from E: frequency 
	- sort by frequency making rare symbols large, reverse does the opposite, 
	(For the weighted versions, each symbol occurence counts as many times 
	as is the length of the clause in which it occurs.) unary_first is like 
	arity, except that unary symbols are maximal (and ties are broken by frequency), 
	unary_frequency is like frequency, except that unary symbols are maximal, 
	const_max makes constants the largest, then falls back to arity, const_min 
	makes constants the smallest, then falls back to reverse_arity, const_frequency 
	makes constants the smallest, then falls back to frequency.

	default: off
--theory_split_queue_cutoffs (-thsqc)
	The cutoff-values for the split-queues (the cutoff value for the last queue 
	has to be omitted, as it is always infinity). Any split-queue contains 
	all clauses which are assigned a feature-value less or equal to the cutoff-value 
	of the queue. If no custom value for this option is set, the implementation 
	will use cutoffs 0,4*d,10*d,infinity (where d denotes the theory split 
	queue expected ratio denominator).
	default: 0
--theory_split_queue_expected_ratio_denom (-thsqd)
	The denominator n such that we expect the final proof to have a ratio of 
	theory-axioms to all-axioms of 1/n.

	reachable clauses
	default: off

--arithmetic_subterm_generalizations (-asg)
	          Enables various generalization rules for arithmetic terms as 
	described in the paper Making Theory Reasoning Simpler ( https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/K2hb 
	).           In some rare cases the conclusion may be not strictly simpler 
	than the hypothesis. With `force` we ignore these cases, violating the 
	ordering and just simplifying           anyways. With `cautious` we will 
	generate a new clause instead of simplifying in these cases.
	default: off
	values: force,cautious,off
--backward_demodulation (-bd)
	Oriented rewriting of kept clauses by newly derived unit equalities
	s = t     L[sθ] \/ C
	---------------------   where sθ > tθ (replaces RHS)
	 L[tθ] \/ C
	
	default: all
	values: all,off,preordered
--backward_subsumption (-bs)
	Perform subsumption deletion of kept clauses by newly derived clauses. 
	Unit_only means that the subsumption will be performed only by unit clauses
	default: off
	values: off,on,unit_only
--backward_subsumption_demodulation (-bsd)
	Perform backward subsumption demodulation.
	default: off
--backward_subsumption_demodulation_max_matches (-bsdmm)
	Maximum number of multi-literal matches to consider in backward subsumption 
	demodulation. 0 means to try all matches (until first success).
	default: 0
--backward_subsumption_resolution (-bsr)
	Perform subsumption resolution on kept clauses using newly derived clauses. 
	Unit_only means that the subsumption resolution will be performed only 
	by unit clauses
	default: off
	values: off,on,unit_only
--binary_resolution (-br)
	Standard binary resolution i.e.
	C \/ t     D \/ s
	---------------------
	(C \/ D)θ
	where θ = mgu(t,-s) and t selected
	default: on
--cancellation (-canc)
	Enables the rule cancellation around additions as described in the paper 
	Making Theory Reasoning Simpler ( https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/K2hb 
	).                                 In some rare cases the conclusion may 
	be not strictly simpler than the hypothesis. With `force` we ignore these 
	cases, violating the ordering and just simplifying                     
	            anyways. With `cautious` we will generate a new clause instead 
	of simplifying in these cases.
	default: off
	values: force,cautious,off
--condensation (-cond)
	Perform condensation. If 'fast' is specified, we only perform condensations 
	that are easy to check for.
	default: off
	values: fast,off,on
--demodulation_redundancy_check (-drc)
	The following cases of backward and forward demodulation do not preserve 
	completeness:
	s = t     s = t1 \/ C 	 s = t     s != t1 \/ C
	--------------------- 	 ---------------------
	t = t1 \/ C 		 t != t1 \/ C
	where t > t1 and s = t > C (RHS replaced)
	With `on`, we check this condition and don't demodulate if we could violate 
	completeness.
	With `encompass`, we treat demodulations (both forward and backward) as 
	encompassment demodulations (as defined by Duarte and Korovin in 2022's 
	IJCAR paper).
	With `off`, we skip the checks, save time, but become incomplete.
	default: on
	values: off,encompass,on
--equational_tautology_removal (-etr)
	A reduction which uses congruence closure to remove logically valid clauses.
	default: off
--extensionality_allow_pos_eq

	other positive equalities when recognising extensionality clauses
	default: off
--extensionality_max_length

	have when doing recognition for extensionality resolution. If zero there 
	is no maximum.

--extensionality_resolution (-er)
	Turns on the following inference rule:
	  x=y \/ C    s != t \/ D
	  -----------------------
	  C{x → s, y → t} \/ D
	Where s!=t is selected in s!=t \/D and x=y \/ C is a recognised as an extensionality 
	clause - how clauses are recognised depends on the value of this option.
	If filter we attempt to recognise all extensionality clauses i.e. those 
	that have exactly one X=Y, no inequality of the same sort as X-Y (and optionally 
	no equality except X=Y, see extensionality_allow_pos_eq).
	If known we only recognise a known set of extensionality clauses. At the 
	moment this includes the standard and subset-based formulations of the 
	set extensionality axiom, as well as the array extensionality axiom.
	If tagged we only use formulas tagged as extensionality clauses.
	default: off
	values: filter,known,tagged,off
--fool_paramodulation (-foolp)
	Turns on the following inference rule:
	        C[s]
	--------------------,
	C[true] \/ s = false
	where s is a boolean term that is not a variable, true or false, C[true] 
	is the C clause with s substituted by true. This rule is needed for efficient 
	treatment of boolean terms.
	default: off
--forward_demodulation (-fd)
	Oriented rewriting of newly derived clauses by kept unit equalities
	s = t     L[sθ] \/ C

	demodulation. 0 means to try all matches (until first success).
	default: 0
--forward_subsumption_resolution (-fsr)
	Perform forward subsumption resolution.
	default: on
--function_definition_introduction (-fdi)
	If non-zero, introduces function definitions with generalisation for repeated 
	compound terms in the active set. For example, if f(a, g(a)) and f(b, g(b)) 
	occur frequently, we might define d(X) = f(X, g(X)). The parameter value 
	'n' is a threshold: terms that occur more than n times have a definition 
	created.
	default: 0
--gaussian_variable_elimination (-gve)
	Enable the immediate simplification "Gaussian Variable Elimination":
	
	s != t \/ C[X] 
	--------------  if s != t can be rewritten to X != r 
	    C[r] 
	
	Example:
	
	6 * X0 != 2 * X1 | p(X0, X1)
	-------------------------------
	  p(2 * X1 / 6, X1)
	
	
	For a more detailed description see the paper Making Theory Reasoning Simpler 
	( https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/K2hb ).           In some 
	rare cases the conclusion may be not strictly simpler than the hypothesis. 
	With `force` we ignore these cases, violating the ordering and just simplifying 
	          anyways. With `cautious` we will generate a new clause instead 
	of simplifying in these cases.
	default: off
	values: force,cautious,off
--global_subsumption (-gs)
	Perform global subsumption. Use a set of groundings of generated clauses 
	G to replace C \/ L by C if the grounding of C is implied by G. A SAT solver 
	is used for ground reasoning.
	default: off
--global_subsumption_avatar_assumptions (-gsaa)
	When running global subsumption and AVATAR at the same time we need to 
	include information about the current AVATAR model. When this is off we 
	ignore clauses with AVATAR assumptions for GS. When it is from_current 
	we assume the assumptions in the current clause. When it is full_model 
	we assume the full model from AVATAR. See paper Global Subsumption Revisited

	default: none
	values: none,struct,int,both

	extends this with skolem constants introduced by induction. Consider using 
	guess_the_goal for problems in SMTLIB as they do not come with a conjecture

	Induction is not applied to _comparison_ literals l:
	  - none: no exclusion
	  - toplevel_not_in_other: t is a top-level argument of l,
	    but it does not occur in the other argument of l
	  - only_one_occurrence: t has only one occurrence in l

--int_induction_strictness_term (-intindstterm)
	Exclude induction term t/literal l combinations from integer induction.
	Induction is not applied to the induction term t:

--max_induction_gen_subset_size (-indgenss)

	Perform superposition from variables.
	default: on
--term_algebra_acyclicity (-tac)
	Activates the cyclicity rule for term algebras (such as algebraic datatypes 
	in SMT-LIB):
	- off : the cyclicity rule is not enforced (this is sound but incomplete)
	- axiom : the cyclicity rule is axiomatized with a transitive predicate 
	describing the subterm relation over terms
	- rule : the cyclicity rule is enforced by a specific hyper-resolution 
	rule
	- light : the cyclicity rule is enforced by rule generating disequality 
	between a term and its known subterms
	default: off
	values: off,axiom,rule,light
--term_algebra_rules (-tar)
	Activates some rules that improve reasoning with term algebras (such as 
	algebraic datatypes in SMT-LIB):
	If the problem does not contain any term algebra symbols, activating this 
	options has no effect
	- distinctness rule:
	f(...) = g(...) \/ A
	--------------------
	          A         
	where f and g are distinct term algebra constructors
	- distinctness tautology deletion: clauses of the form f(...) ~= g(...) 
	\/ A are deleted
	- injectivity rule:
	f(s1 ... sn) = f(t1 ... tn) \/ A
	--------------------------------
	         s1 = t1 \/ A

	where  
	 -  T[x_1, ..., x_n] is a pure theory clause  
	 - ~T[t_1, ...., t_n] is valid 
	
	The rule uses an smt solver (i.e. z3 atm) to find t_1...t_n that satisfy 
	the requirement for the rule.
	
	The different option values define the behaviour of which theory literals 
	to select.
	- all    : hmmm.. what could that mean?!
	- neg_eq : only negative equalities
	- strong : interpreted predicates, but no positive equalities
	- overlap: all literals that contain variables that are also contained 
	in a strong literal

	- full   : deprecated
	default: off
	values: off,all,strong,neg_eq,overlap,full,new
--unification_with_abstraction (-uwa)
	During unification, if two terms s and t fail to unify we will introduce 
	a constraint s!=t and carry on. For example, resolving p(1) \/ C with ~p(a+2)

	The expected use case is in theory reasoning. The possible values are:- 
	off: do not introduce a constraint
	- interpreted_only: only if s and t have interpreted top symbols
	- one_side_interpreted: only if one of s or t have interpreted top symbols
	- one_side_constant: only if one of s or t is an interpreted constant (e.g. 
	a number)
	- all: always apply
	- ground: only if both s and t are ground
	See Unification with Abstraction and Theory Instantiation in Saturation-Based 
	Reasoning for further details.

	provably satisfied by the partial model.
	default: all
	values: off,sco,all
--avatar_nonsplittable_components (-anc)
	Decide what to do with a nonsplittable component:
	  -known: SAT clauses will be learnt from non-splittable clauses that have 
	corresponding components (if there is a component C with name SAT l, clause 
	C | {l1,..ln} will give SAT clause ~l1 \/ … \/ ~ln \/ l). When we add 
	the sat clause, we discard the original FO clause C | {l1,..ln} and let 
	the component selection update model, possibly adding the component clause 
	C | {l}.
	  -all: like known, except when we see a non-splittable clause that doesn't 
	have a name, we introduce the name for it.

--avatar_split_queue_layered_arrangement (-avsql)
	If turned on, use a layered arrangement to split clauses into queues. Otherwise 
	use a tammet-style-arrangement.
	default: off
--avatar_split_queue_ratios (-avsqr)
	The ratios for picking clauses from the split-queues using weighted round 
	robin. If a queue is empty, the clause will be picked from the next non-empty 
	queue to the right. Note that this option implicitly also sets the number 
	of queues.
	default: 1,1
--avatar_turn_off_time_frac (-atotf)
	Stop splitting after the specified fraction of the overall time has passed 
	(the default 1.0 means AVATAR runs until the end).
	(the remaining time AVATAR is still switching branches and communicating 
	with the SAT solver,
	but not introducing new splits anymore. This fights the theoretical possibility 
	of AVATAR's dynamic incompleteness.)

	for that n. See Symmetry Avoidance in MACE-Style Finite Model Finding.
	default: 1

	The order of symbols considered for symmetry avoidance. See Symmetry Avoidance

	Performs instantiation together with resolution (global subsumption index 
	is shared, also clauses generated by the resolution are added to the instance

	them off
	default: on
--minimize_sat_proofs (-msp)
	Perform unsat core minimization when a sat solver finds a clause set UNSAT
	(such as with AVATAR proofs or with global subsumption).
	default: on
--output_axiom_names
	Preserve names of axioms from the problem file in the proof output
	default: off
--output_mode (-om)
	Change how Vampire prints the final result. SZS uses TPTP's SZS ontology. 
	smtcomp mode suppresses all output and just prints sat/unsat. vampire is 
	the same as SZS just without the SZS. Spider prints out some profile information 
	and extra error reports. ucore uses the smt-lib ucore output.
	default: szs
	values: smtcomp,spider,szs,vampire,ucore
--print_clausifier_premises
	Output how the clausified problem was derived.
	default: off
--print_proofs_to_file (-pptf)
	If Vampire finds a proof, it is printed to the here specified file instead 
	of to stdout.
	Currently, this option only works in portfolio mode.
	default: <empty>
--proof (-p)
	Specifies whether proof (or similar e.g. model/saturation) will be output 
	and in which format:
	- off gives no proof output
	- on gives native Vampire proof output
	- proofcheck will output proof as a sequence of TPTP problems to allow 
	for proof-checking by external solvers
	- tptp gives TPTP output
	- property is a developmental option. It allows developers to output statistics 
	about the proof using a ProofPrinter object (see Kernel/InferenceStore::ProofPropertyPrinter
	
	default: on
	values: off,on,proofcheck,tptp,property
--proof_extra
	Add extra detail to proofs:
	 - free uses known information only
	- full may perform expensive operations to achieve this so may significantly 
	impact on performance.
	 The option is still under development and the format of extra information 
	(mainly from full) may change between minor releases
	default: off
	values: off,free,full
--show_fmb_sort_info
	Print information about sorts in FMB
	default: off
--show_fool
	Reveal the internal representation of FOOL terms
	default: off
--show_induction
	Print information about induction
	default: off
--show_ordering
	Display the used simplification ordering's parameters.
	default: off
--statistics (-stat)
	The level of statistics to report at the end of the run.
	default: brief
	values: brief,full,none
--time_statistics (-tstat)
	Show how much running time was spent in each part of Vampire
	default: off

--arity_check
	Enforce the condition that the same symbol name cannot be used with multiple 
	arities.This also ensures a symbol is not used as a function and predicate.
	default: off
--decode
	Decodes an encoded strategy. Can be used to replay a strategy. To make 
	Vampire output an encoded version of the strategy use the encode option.
	default: 
--encode
	Output an encoding of the strategy to be used with the decode option
	default: off
--export_avatar
	Export the avatar problems to solve in smtlib syntax.
	default: <empty>
--export_thi
	Export the theory instantiation problems to solve in smtlib syntax.
	default: <empty>
--ignore_missing
	Ignore any options that have been removed (useful in portfolio modes where 
	this can cause strategies to be skipped). If set to warn this will print 
	a warning when ignoring. This is set to warn in CASC mode.
	default: off
	values: on,off,warn
--manual_cs
	Run Vampire interactively by manually picking the clauses to be selected
	default: off
--parsing_does_not_count
	Extend the instruction limit by the amount of instructions it took to parse 
	the input problem.
	default: off
--random_strategy
	Create a random strategy. Randomisation will occur after all other options 
	have been set, whatever order they have been given in. A random number 
	of options will be selected  and set with a safe (possibly default) value.
	default: off
	values: on,off,sat,nocheck
--show_active
	Print activated clauses.
	default: off
--show_blocked
	Show generating inferences blocked due to coloring of symbols
	default: off
--show_definitions
	Show definition introductions.
	default: off
--show_everything
	Turn (almost) all of the showX commands on
	default: off
--show_new
	Show new (generated) clauses
	default: off
--show_nonconstant_skolem_function_trace
	Show introduction of non-constant skolem functions.
	default: off
--show_passive
	Show clauses added to the passive set.
	default: off
--show_preprocessing
	Show preprocessing.
	default: off
--show_reductions
	Show reductions.
	default: off
--show_skolemisations
	Show Skolemisations.
	default: off
--show_splitting
	Show updates within AVATAR
	default: off
--show_symbol_elimination
	Show symbol elimination.
	default: off
--show_theory_axioms
	Show the added theory axioms.
	default: off
--show_z3
	Print the clauses being added to Z3
