 /nologo       suppress printing of version number, copyright message
  /env:<n>      print command line arguments
                  0 - never, 1 (default) - during BPL print and prover log,
                  2 - like 1 and also to standard output
  /printVerifiedProceduresCount:<n>
                0 - no
                1 (default) - yes
  /wait         await Enter from keyboard before terminating program
  /xml:<file>   also produce output in XML format to <file>

  ---- Boogie options --------------------------------------------------------

  Multiple .bpl files supplied on the command line are concatenated into one
  Boogie program.

  /proc:<p>      : Only check procedures matched by pattern <p>. This option
                   may be specified multiple times to match multiple patterns.
                   The pattern <p> matches the whole procedure name (i.e.
                   pattern "foo" will only match a procedure called foo and
                   not fooBar). The pattern <p> may contain * wildcards which
                   match any character zero or more times. For example the
                   pattern "ab*d" would match abd, abcd and abccd but not
                   Aabd nor abdD. The pattern "*ab*d*" would match abd,
                   abcd, abccd, Abd and abdD.
  /noResolve     : parse only
  /noTypecheck   : parse and resolve only

  /print:<file>  : print Boogie program after parsing it
                   (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /pretty:<n>
                0 - print each Boogie statement on one line (faster).
                1 (default) - pretty-print with some line breaks.
  /printWithUniqueIds : print augmented information that uniquely
                   identifies variables
  /printUnstructured : with /print option, desugars all structured statements
  /printDesugared : with /print option, desugars calls
  /printLambdaLifting : with /print option, desugars lambda lifting

  /freeVarLambdaLifting : Boogie's lambda lifting transforms the bodies of lambda
                         expressions into templates with holes. By default, holes
                         are maximally large subexpressions that do not contain
                         bound variables. This option performs a form of lambda
                         lifting in which holes are the lambda's free variables.

                2 - print Z3's error model plus reverse mappings
                4 - print Z3's error model in a more human readable way
  /printModelToFile:<file>
                print model to <file> instead of console
  /mv:<file>    Specify file where to save the model in BVD format
  /enhancedErrorMessages:<n>
                0 (default) - no enhanced error messages
                1 - Z3 error model enhanced error messages

  /printCFG:<prefix> : print control flow graph of each implementation in
                       Graphviz format to files named:
                         <prefix>.<procedure name>.dot

  /useBaseNameForFileName : When parsing use basename of file for tokens instead
                            of the path supplied on the command line

                       other domains)
                   j = stronger intervals (cannot be combined with other
                       domains)
                or the following (which denote options, not domains):

                2 - use the more advanced verification result caching
                3 - use the more advanced caching and report errors according
                    to the new source locations for errors and their

                apply subsumption to asserted conditions:
                0 - never, 1 - not for quantifiers, 2 (default) - always
  /alwaysAssumeFreeLoopInvariants
                usually, a free loop invariant (or assume
                statement in that position) is ignored in checking contexts
                (like other free things); this option includes these free
                loop invariants as assumes in both contexts
  /inline:<i>   use inlining strategy <i> for procedures with the :inline
                attribute, see /attrHelp for details:
                  none

  /stratifiedInline:1
                Use the stratified inlining algorithm
  /fixedPointEngine:<engine>

                are prefixed by <str>) that need to be set to
                true for the program to be correct. This turns
                on stratified inlining.
  /smoke        Soundness Smoke Test: try to stick assert false; in some
                places in the BPL and see if we can still prove it
  /smokeTimeout:<n>
                Timeout, in seconds, for a single theorem prover

  /monomorphize   
                Do not abstract map types in the encoding (this is an
                experimental feature that will not do the right thing if
                the program uses polymorphism)
  /reflectAdd   In the VC, generate an auxiliary symbol, elsewhere defined
                to be +, instead of +.

  ---- Verification-condition splitting --------------------------------------

  /vcsMaxCost:<f>
                VC will not be split unless the cost of a VC exceeds this
                number, defaults to 2000.0. This does NOT apply in the
                keep-going mode after first round of splitting.
  /vcsMaxSplits:<n>
                Maximal number of VC generated per method. In keep
                going mode only applies to the first round.
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsMaxKeepGoingSplits:<n>
                If set to more than 1, activates the keep
                going mode, where after the first round of splitting,
                VCs that timed out are split into <n> pieces and retried
                until we succeed proving them, or there is only one
                assertion on a single path and it timeouts (in which
                case error is reported for that assertion).
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsKeepGoingTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for a single theorem prover
                invocation in keep going mode, except for the final
                single-assertion case. Defaults to 1s.
  /vcsFinalAssertTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for the single last
                assertion in the keep going mode. Defaults to 30s.
  /vcsPathJoinMult:<f>
                If more than one path join at a block, by how much
                multiply the number of paths in that block, to accomodate
                for the fact that the prover will learn something on one
                paths, before proceeding to another. Defaults to 0.8.
  /vcsPathCostMult:<f1>
  /vcsAssumeMult:<f2>
                The cost of a block is
                    (<assert-cost> + <f2>*<assume-cost>) * 
                    (1.0 + <f1>*<entering-paths>)
                <f1> defaults to 1.0, <f2> defaults to 0.01.
                The cost of a single assertion or assumption is
                currently always 1.0.
  /vcsPathSplitMult:<f>
                If the best path split of a VC of cost A is into
                VCs of cost B and C, then the split is applied if
                A >= <f>*(B+C), otherwise assertion splitting will be
                applied. Defaults to 0.5 (always do path splitting if
                possible), set to more to do less path splitting
                and more assertion splitting.
  /vcsDumpSplits
                For split #n dump split.n.dot and split.n.bpl.
                Warning: Affects error reporting.
  /vcsCores:<n>
                Try to verify <n> VCs at once. Defaults to 1.
  /vcsLoad:<f>  Sets vcsCores to the machine's ProcessorCount * f,
                rounded to the nearest integer (where 0.0 <= f <= 3.0),
                but never to less than 1.

  ---- Prover options --------------------------------------------------------

  /errorLimit:<num>
                Limit the number of errors produced for each procedure

                2 - include all Trace labels in the error output
  /vcBrackets:<b>
                bracket odd-charactered identifier names with |'s.  <b> is:
                   0 - no (default with non-/prover:Simplify),
                   1 - yes (default with /prover:Simplify)
  /prover:<tp>  use theorem prover <tp>, where <tp> is either the name of
                a DLL containing the prover interface located in the
                Boogie directory, or a full path to a DLL containing such
                an interface. The standard interfaces shipped include:
                    SMTLib (default, uses the SMTLib2 format and calls Z3)
                    Z3 (uses Z3 with the Simplify format)
                    Simplify
                    ContractInference (uses Z3)
                    Z3api (Z3 using Managed .NET API)
  /proverOpt:KEY[=VALUE]
                Provide a prover-specific option (short form /p).
  /proverLog:<file>
                Log input for the theorem prover.  Like filenames
                supplied as arguments to other options, <file> can use the
                following macros:
                    @TIME@    expands to the current time
                    @PREFIX@  expands to the concatenation of strings given
                              by /logPrefix options
                    @FILE@    expands to the last filename specified on the
                              command line
                In addition, /proverLog can also use the macro '@PROC@',
                which causes there to be one prover log file per
                verification condition, and the macro then expands to the
                name of the procedure that the verification condition is for.
  /logPrefix:<str>
                Defines the expansion of the macro '@PREFIX@', which can
                be used in various filenames specified by other options.
  /proverLogAppend
                Append (not overwrite) the specified prover log file
